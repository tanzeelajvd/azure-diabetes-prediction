# Diabetes Diagnostic System (Azure ML)



This repository presents a \*\*simple Python-based desktop application\*\* that demonstrates a diabetes prediction workflow using a \*\*Microsoft Azure Machine Learning web service\*\*, implemented in accordance with the methodology described in the associated research paper.



The project is intended as an \*\*academic prototype\*\*, focusing on clarity, reproducibility, and conceptual alignment with the paper rather than production-level deployment.



---



\## Project Overview



The application provides a lightweight graphical interface that allows users to:



\- Trigger a diabetes prediction process

\- Send patient-related features to a deployed Azure ML endpoint

\- Obtain prediction results generated by the Azure ML model

\- Access educational information related to diabetes



The core machine learning inference is performed remotely via Azure ML, while the local application serves as a simple interaction layer.

\## Research Paper Reference



This implementation is based on the following research paper:



\*\*“Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques on Azure Cloud Platform”\*\*  

🔗 https://ijsrcseit.com/CSEIT411809



The repository serves as a practical demonstration of the cloud-based prediction workflow described in the paper.

\## How the Application Works



1\. The application is launched from `main.py`.

2\. Clicking \*\*Predict Diabetes\*\* executes the Azure ML inference script.

3\. Patient data is sent to an Azure Machine Learning REST endpoint.

4\. The deployed model processes the input and returns a prediction.

5\. The result is handled by the application logic.

6\. The \*\*Learn About Diabetes\*\* button opens an external educational resource.

\## Environment Setup



Install required dependencies using:



```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

````



> Note: Tkinter is included with standard Python distributions and does not require separate installation.

\## Running the Application



From the project root directory, run:



```bash

python app/main.py

```



---



\## Azure Machine Learning Dependency



To run predictions successfully, the following must be configured in `azure\_diabetic.py`:



\* Azure ML REST endpoint URL

\* Valid API key or authentication token

\* Deployed diabetes prediction model on Azure ML



Replace placeholder values with your own Azure credentials.
